Ever wanted to know what the keybindings are for the most frequently used menu actions? Look no further…

Ergo will provide exactly what you’re looking for! As you use Eclipse, Ergo will watch your every move, recording how often you use actions and whether you invoked them from a menu or keybinding. You can even sort the columns in Ergo’s view!!

All you need is Eclipse 3.4 M3 or later, and install the plugin using this update site: [http://www.stateofflow.com/UpdateSite](http://www.stateofflow.com/UpdateSite)
(We'll add a Google code update site soon.)

Your days of wondering what keybindings to use are over.

If you have any problems please report them under the issues tab.
